Depth Panorama Test
By Kojack
Copyright 2019

This is a test of my technique for improving the feeling of 360 panoramas in VR by projecting onto a ground plane and increasing the degrees of freedom.

Controls:
A - Toggle ground plane
B - Cycle to the next panorama
X - Cycle to the next degree of freedom. There are 3, 4 and 6 DOF available.
Right Thumbstick click - Reset position/orientation
Index Triggers - Spawn a cube
Grip Triggers - Grab a cube

Panorama 4 was captured by me from The Witness using Nvidia Ansel.
Panoramas 1, 2 and 3 are from the European Southern Observatory (images rescaled to 8192x4096 to suit GPUs):
